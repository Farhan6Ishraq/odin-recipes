    <h1>How to make Brownies</h1>
    <p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>For the brownies:</strong> butter, white sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, cocoa powder, all-purpose flour, salt, and baking powder</li>
        <li><strong>For the frosting:</strong> butter, cocoa powder, honey, vanilla extract, confectioners' sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the brownies:</strong> Melt the butter on the stove, then remove from heat and add the remaining wet ingredients. Beat in the dry ingredients. Spread the batter in the pan and bake.</li>
        <li><strong>Frost the brownies:</strong> Stir the frosting ingredients together until well-combined, then frost the brownies while they are still warm. Cut into squares when cool.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How to Tell If Brownies Are Done</h2>
    <p>You'll know the brownies are done baking when the top is dry and the edges are pulling away from the pan. Baked in an oven preheated to 350 degrees F, the brownies should be ready after about 25 to 30 minutes.</p>

    <h2>How Long Do Brownies Last?</h2>
    <p>Brownies will last 3 to 4 days in an airtight container at room temperature and up to a week in the refrigerator. Since these brownies are frosted, either store them in a single layer or stack them with wax paper between each layer.</p>
