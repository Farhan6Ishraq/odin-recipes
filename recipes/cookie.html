    <h1>Granola Oatmeal cookies</h1>
    <p>There is no less interesting cookie to me than a plain oatmeal cookie but if you are making them with granola they turn from mundane to magnificent. This cookie is so far superior in both taste and texture to regular oatmeal cookies that it might just be the best cookie.</p>
    <img src="./cookie.jpeg" alt="picture of cookies">
    <p>There are certain cookies that require us to take sides. Are you a thin, chewy, crisp-around-the-edges chocolate chip person, or a thick, soft, cakey chocolate chip person? Do you want your gingersnaps to snap loudly, and cleanly in half, or bend quietly, and melt in your mouth? There are no wrong answers, but you have to pick. Well, what happens if you can't?</p>
    <p>I like both styles of oatmeal cookies, or at least I like very specific parts of both. I like the texture of the thick, soft, chewy ones, but I prefer the toasty, caramelized flavor of the thin, crispy ones. So, instead of picking, I decided to try and have the best of both versions, and that was the inspiration behind this rather generic sounding Granola Oatmeal Cookie.</p>
    <p>I wish I had a catchier, more exciting name for what I think is a major advance in oatmeal cookie technology, but I'll just have to rely on the incredible taste and texture to make these memorable. By adding already baked oatmeal, in the form of granola, we get the flavor of a crisp cookie, without sacrificing that addictively chewy texture. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to enjoy a few with a cup of coffee, and work on that name. So, stay tuned for that, but in the meantime, I really do hope you give these a try soon. Enjoy!</p>

    <h1>How to make Granola Oatmeal Cookies</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup finely crumbled prepared granola</li>
        <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
        <li>½ cup firmly packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup white granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>½ cup old-fashioned rolled oats</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat (such as Silpat™) or parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in a bowl and whisk for 30 seconds until dry ingredients are well combined.</li>
        <li>Combine butter, light brown sugar, and granulated sugar in a second bowl. Cream with an electric beater until mixture is light and fluffy. Add egg and mix on high speed until well combined. Add vanilla extract and cinnamon and beat in.</li>
        <li>Fold in dry ingredients with a spatula just until flour disappears. Fold in granola and oats until well combined.</li>
        <li>Scoop out tablespoonfuls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving ample space between the dough balls as they will spread out, about 8 per baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake on the center rack in the preheated oven until cookies are golden brown, 13 to 15 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and cool completely. Repeat with remaining dough.</li>
    </ol>
